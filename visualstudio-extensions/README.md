# Visual Studio Extensions

This is a list of Visual Studio extensions installed:

## 1. CSharpier
CSharpier is an opinionated code formatter for C#. It automatically formats C# code files to ensure a consistent style across your projects, similar to how Prettier works for JavaScript. It helps maintain code readability and enforces best practices by applying a standard formatting style.

## 2. WakaTime
WakaTime is an automatic time-tracking extension for Visual Studio. It tracks your coding activity and provides metrics and insights about your programming habits. WakaTime helps you understand how much time you spend coding, which projects you work on most, and can generate detailed reports for productivity analysis.

**Note:** I have configured my own WakaTime settings. For installation steps, troubleshooting, and custom configuration details, see [`wakatime/README.md`](wakatime/README.md).
